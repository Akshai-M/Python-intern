-print("$%6d$"1122):-Here %6d will take six spaces but according to integer value assigned it will print the space
o/p:- $__1122$


1.padding(0):- 	     $001122$(0's will be printed in the place of space)
2.justification(-):- $1122  $(content will jutified on right side)
3.sign(+):-1st prior	     $ +1122$

	|%| |flag| |width| |precision| |code|

	stack token

print("$%+6d$"%-1122,end="")
print("$%0-+9d$"%1122)  :-	$ -1122$$+1122    $
(both the statements will be printed in one line)

POP v/s OOP:-

1.Paradigm Focus:- 
pop:-the prog is structured around procedures or functions that operate on data.
oop:-the prog is designed as a collection of objects.

2.Data Handling:-
pop:- Data & procedures are seperate.Fuction takes data as i/p,process it and gives result
oop:-Objects contain both data and methods.Objects can operate on their own data,promoting encapsulation

3.Reusability:-
pop:-Functions can be reused but emphasis is not inherently on reusing code structures.
oop:-code reuse through the creation of classes and obj.Once a class is defined,it can be instantiated

4.Encapsulation:-
pop:-Data is often global or passed b/w f().There's less control over accesss to data.
oop:-Data is hidden within the obj's,access to data is controlled through methods,enhancing,security and control.

Compiler v/s Interpreter:-

1.Translate
Entire prog v/s One stat at a time
2.Error Generation Occurence
After complete translation v/s Stops translation immediately
3.Translation unit
Obj code v/s Byte code
4.Execution of code
Only Translate v/s Translate as well as execute
5.Faster v/s slower

Data types:-
A)what value it can have or hold.
B)what operation can be performed on it.

Data Types:-
Basic Data Types are
1)Numbers

a.Integer:-
1.include 0,+ve whole no's,-ve whole no's
2.Integer literals in a python are written without commas
3.Leading -ve sign indicates a -ve value
4.Python integer is much loonger and is limites only by the memory of your computer i.e no limitation on inteer type
5.NO limitation on this dt

b.Floating point:-
1.Limitations on floatingpoint number

c.Complex

2)String
-Raw string:-
1.If you want to specify a string that should not handle any escape sequence & want to display exactly as specified then you need to specify that string as a raw atring
2.A Rs can be specified by using r Or R TO the string

print("HELLO\'"):-	HELLO'
print(r"HELLO\'"):-	HELLO\'
	
3)Boolean
1.A varbile of Boolean type can have one of the two values True or False

Operators:
1.Arithmetic floor division:-
On performing floor division a / / b,result is the largest integer which is <= to the quotient(roundoff the value)

2.Arithmetic modulus operator(%)
a%b
a-(b*(a//b))

3.Arithmetic exp operator(**)
base=2
exp=3
res=base**exp or res=pow(2,3)
print(res):-8

4.Logical:-(when we want to evaluate more than 1repression in single statement)
the result of last expression will be res of entire expression
k=11
res=k<22 and 1122| res= and k<22                 
print(res):-1122 | true   

5.membership-in and not in 
-Test for membership in a seq such as strings,lists, tuples
- in operators:The operator returns true if a variable is found in the specified seq and false otherwise
- not in:The operator returns true if a variable is not found in the specified seq and false otherwise

6.identity -is and is not
is: returns true if both operands on the both sides of operator are pointing to the same obj
is not: returns true if both operands on the both sides of operator does not pointing to the same obj

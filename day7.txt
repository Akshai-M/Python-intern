LISTS:-
1.Seq of coma-seperated values/ele/items b/w square brackets
2.Ele that belong to different Dt 
Syntax:List_variable=[val1,val2,val3....valn]

ACCESS VALUE WITH INDEX:-
1.+ve index value count from left to right start with 0
2.-ve index value count from right to left start with -1

CONCATENATION OPERATOR:-
lst
lst1
lst2
lst3=lst1+lst2
NESTED LIST:-
lsit=[10,20,[30,40,50],60,70]
	      0  1  2
      0   1       3     4  5
BUILT-IN FUNCTION:-
len(list)

METHODS:-
append():
1.Add an ele to the end of a list
2.Modifies the original list & does not return a new list

count(): count the occurence of a specified ele in list

index():
1.Find the index of the 1st occurrence of a specified ele in list
2.If the specified ele is not present in the list,will raise a value Error

insert():
1.Insert an ele at a specified position within a list
2.Takes two args:the index at which to insert the new ele and the value of the ele you want to insert

pop():
remove and return an ele from a specified index in a list

sort():in ascending order

extend():add the ele of an iterable to the end of an existing list.

remove():specified value from list
2.in value range is not present it will raise Error

copy():create a shallow copy of a list

CLONING LISTS:-
1.Cloning allows you to work with a copy of the data without affecting the original list
2.Slice operation is used to clone a list

USING THE enumerate() and range() ():-
enumerate to iterate through the list along with index value

LIST COMPREHENSION:-used to perform operation on list
new_list=[exp for ele in seq if condition]
